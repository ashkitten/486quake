486quake
========

this is an attempt to ressurect the original Quake DOS sources, clean up the bitrot just enough to be able
to build with modern toolchains, and try out modern compiler optimizations to see if this is sufficient
to make the game notably faster, particularly on 486-class machines.

this should build on any machine with DJGPP installed and the environment set up properly.
